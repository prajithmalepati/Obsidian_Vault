-  [[Databricks]] is the lake house platform
- A lakehouse is a new, open architecture that combines the best elements of data lakes and data warehouses. [[Lakehouse]] are enabled by a new system design: implementing similar data structures and data management features to those in a data warehouse directly on top of low cost cloud storage in open formats. 
- They are what you would get if you had to redesign data warehouses in the modern world, now that cheap and highly reliable storage (in the form of object stores) are available.
- The Lakehouse is for all data practitioners
