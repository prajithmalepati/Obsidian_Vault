- Delta Sharing is the industry’s first open protocol for secure data sharing, making it simple to share data with other organizations regardless of which computing platforms they use.

 - **Share live data directly** - Easily share live data in your Delta Lake without copying it to another system.

- **Support diverse clients** - Data recipients can directly connect to Delta Shares from Pandas, Apache Spark™, Rust, and other systems without having to first deploy a specific compute pattern. Reduce the friction to get your data to your users.

- **Security and governance** - Delta Sharing allows you to easily govern, track, and audit access to your shared datasets.

- **Scalability** - Share terabyte-scale datasets reliably and efficiently by leveraging cloud storage systems like S3, ADLS, and GCS.
